# online-retail-sales-analysis

This project uses a data set of online retail transaction data to do analysis with Python. The first of the three approaches taken are referred to as 'data cleaning', followed by 'revenue engineering' and lastly, 'The data analysis'; these through each of these three approaches help determine the key products, country, and time-based trends in the associated transactional revenues generated through the data set.

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Key Insights from the analysis
- The distribution of revenue across all products is not concentrated in any one area
- The vast majority of sales occurred in the United Kingdom
- The distribution of revenue has shown to demonstrate seasonality (i.e. typically would see more sales prior to Christmas).
